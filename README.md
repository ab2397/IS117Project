# IS117Project
This is my first major project that test the skills that I learn for my Intro to Web Design class.
I was tasked to create a website, using HTML/CSS, based on any topic that I choose. I decided
to make my website about a fictional website which included five Web Pages in total:
1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Contact Page
4. Algerian Meal Page
5. American Meal Page
Bootstrap was used to make a Responsive Design for the website
